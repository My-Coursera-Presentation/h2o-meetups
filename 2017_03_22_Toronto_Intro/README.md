## Intro to ML and [H2o.ai](http://www.h2o.ai)

#### [Sample IPython notebooks folder](src)

Please download the IPython notebooks and data before the meetup in case internet is not available at the meetup venue. You can do so by clicking on the link to the notebook in the [notebooks folder](src), clicking raw and then saving the file from the browser OR you can clone this repository using git.

Please install prerequisite software before attending the meetup in case internet is not available at the meetup venue. We probably will not have time to install and troubleshoot during the meetup, but we may be able to answer questions if you get there a little early.

To follow along with all hands-on material please install:

* [64-bit Java](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
* [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [H2o Python package](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-ueno/7/index.html) (*Install in Python* Tab)

If you would like to try H2o in the simplest possible manner (i.e. without Python, using only H2o's "point-and-click" *Flow* interface), then you will need the following software:

* [64-bit Java](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
* [H2o Java jar](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-ueno/7/index.html) (*Download and Run* Tab)
